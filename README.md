**Airline Delay Predictor Project**

**Project Overview:**
The Airline Delay Predictor Project aims to develop a machine-learning model that predicts flight delays using historical data. The project enhances decision-making in air travel by providing airlines and passengers with real-time delay predictions. The model's predictions help airlines optimize their schedules, improve customer satisfaction, and reduce operational costs. For passengers, the predictions can inform travel planning and minimize the impact of delays on their schedules.

**Key Features:**
1. **Machine Learning Model:** The project develops a predictive model using Scikit-Learn. The model analyzes historical flight data to identify patterns and factors contributing to delays.
   
2. **Technological Stack:** The project utilizes Python(Pandas) for data processing and modeling and Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.

3. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** The project includes thorough data cleaning and preprocessing steps to ensure the quality and accuracy of the input data. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.

The Airline Delay Predictor Project leverages machine learning and data analysis techniques to improve decision-making in air travel. By accurately predicting flight delays, the project helps airlines and passengers better manage their travel plans and reduces the overall impact of delays on the aviation industry.
